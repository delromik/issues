This repository is intended to serve as a container repository for small project that are reproducing issues. They should help with the bug reporting as they:

1. Show sample code that reproduces the issue. You know - a line of code is worth thousand words :smile:.
2. The provide quick and easy way to debug the problem. The projects are executable so you just need to run them to get the issue reproduced.

Well, of course unit or integration test are usually better for such things, but sometime I'm not sure how exactly to reproduce it with automated tests of the project.
Or don't have the time to create one. So this is a kind of middle ground.
